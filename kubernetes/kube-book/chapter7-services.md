* Every time you create a Service, the EndpointSlice controller automatically creates an associated EndpointSlice object. Kubernetes then watches the cluster, looking for Pods matching the Serviceâ€™s label selector. Any new Pods matching the selector
gets added to the EndpointSlice, whereas any deleted Pods get removed.
EndpointSlice objects keep an up-to-date list of healthy Pods matching the label selector
