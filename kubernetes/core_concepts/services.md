# Services

* Every time you create a Service, the EndpointSlice controller automatically creates an associated EndpointSlice object.
* Kubernetes then watches the cluster, looking for Pods matching the Serviceâ€™s label selector. Any new Pods matching the selector
get added to the EndpointSlice, whereas any deleted Pods get removed.
* NodePort -> listens to port on the cluster node and forwards requests to pods
* ClusterIP -> creates VIP inside cluster to enable connectivity between different services i.e. frontend to backend
* LoadBalancer -> Provisions loadbalancer in supported cloud providers

## NodePort

!["nodeport](/images/nodeport.png)

* port -> port number on service
* ip -> ip address on service
* TargetPort port number on pod
* NodePort - > port number on cluster node

## create service from definition file
`kubectl create -f service-definition.yaml`
# Create a service imperatively for an nginx deployment, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
`kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000`
## display services
`kubectl get services`
## view url on minikube
`minikube service service_name --url`
