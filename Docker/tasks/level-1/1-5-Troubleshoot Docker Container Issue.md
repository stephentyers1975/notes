# Troubleshoot Docker Container Issue
An issue has arisen with a static website running in a container named nautilus on App Server 1. To resolve the issue, investigate the following details:

Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.

Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.

`docker start nautilus`
`docker inspect nautilus`
